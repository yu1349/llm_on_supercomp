input_sample::: {'text': '[SectionTitle] 4 Composition in a K&G Parser [Body] Parser We use UUParser, a variant of the K&G transition-based parser that employs the arc-hybrid transition system from Kuhlmann et al. (2011) extended with a S WAP transition and a Static-Dynamic oracle, as described in de Lhoneux et al. (2017b) [Cite_Footnote_4] . The S WAP transition is used to allow the construction of non-projective dependency trees (Nivre, 2009). We use default hyperparameters. When using POS tags, we use the universal POS tags from the UD treebanks which are coarse-grained and consistent across languages. Those POS tags are predicted by UDPipe (Straka et al., 2016) both for training and parsing. This parser obtained the 7th best LAS score on average in the 2018 CoNLL shared task (Zeman et al., 2018), about 2.5 LAS points below the best system, which uses an ensemble system as well as ELMo embed-dings, as introduced by Peters et al. (2018). Note, however, that we use a slightly impoverished ver-sion of the model used for the shared task which is described in Smith et al. (2018a): we use a less ac-curate POS tagger (UDPipe) and we do not make use of multi-treebank models. In addition, Smith et al. (2018a) use the three top items of the stack as well as the first item of the buffer to represent the configuration, while we only use the two top items of the stack and the first item of the buffer. Smith et al. (2018a) also use an extended feature set as introduced by Kiperwasser and Goldberg (2016b) where they also use the rightmost and left-most children of the items of the stack and buffer that they consider. We do not use that extended feature set. This is to keep the parser settings as simple as possible and avoid adding confounding factors. It is still a near-SOTA model. We evaluate parsing models on the development sets and report the average of the 5 best results in 30 epochs and 5 runs with different random seeds.

Intuitively, popular product features are frequently mentioned in reviews, so they can be extracted by simply mining frequently occurring nouns (Hu and Liu, 2004). However, this strategy will also find many noise terms (e.g., commonly used nouns like thing, one, etc.). To produce high quality seeds, we employ a Domain Relevance Measure (DRM) (Jiang and Tan, 2010), which combines term frequency with a domain-specific measuring metric called Likelihood Ratio Test (LRT) (Dunning, 1993). Let λ(t) denotes the LRT score of a product feature candidate t, where k 1 and k 2 are the frequencies of t in the review corpus R and a background corpus [Cite_Footnote_1] B, n 1 and n 2 are the total number of terms in R and B, p = (k 1 + k 2 )/(n 1 + n 2 ), p 1 = k 1 /n 1 and p 2 = k 2 /n 2 .

How-ever, these models lack a mechanism to ac-count for relevant syntactical constraints and long-range word dependencies, and hence may mistakenly recognize syntactically irrelevant contextual words as clues for judging aspect sentiment. To tackle this problem, we pro-pose to build a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) over the dependency tree of a sentence to exploit syntactical information and word dependencies. Based on it, a novel aspect-specific sentiment classification framework is raised. Experiments on three benchmarking collections illustrate that our proposed model has comparable effectiveness to a range of state-of-the-art models [Cite_Footnote_1] , and further demon-strate that both syntactical information and long-range word dependencies are properly captured by the graph convolution structure.\nFootnote or Reference Text: 1 Code and preprocessed datasets are available at https://github.com/GeneZC/ASGCN.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nBased on the given information, here's the extracted meta-information about the research data:\n\n- **Title:** ASGCN (Aspect-Specific Graph Convolutional Network)\n- **Authors:** GeneZC (no co-authors mentioned)\n- **Year:** Not mentioned\n- **Journal/Conference:** Not mentioned\n- **DOI:** Not mentioned\n- **URL:** https://github.com/GeneZC/ASGCN\n- **Code Availability:** Yes, available at the provided URL\n- **Dataset Availability:** Yes, preprocessed datasets available at the provided URL\n- **Citation:** [Cite_Footnote_1] (no full citation information provided)\n- **Research Area:** Aspect-based sentiment classification using Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) and dependency trees."}]

Thus, GCNF is a more restrictive normal form than those used by Wu (1997) and Melamed (2003). The absence of ’s simplifies parsers for GMTG (Melamed, 2004)  . Given a GMTG u with in some productions, we give the construction of a weakly equivalent gram-mar u9O without any ’s. First, determine all nullable links and associated - strings in u . - A link * Z Z is nullable if < y is an ITV where at least one y•bhg is . We say the link is nullable and the string at address in is nullable. For each nullable link, we create versions of the link, where is the number of nullable strings of that link. There is one version for each of the possible combinations of the nullable strings being present or absent. The version of the link with all strings present is its original version. Each non-original version of the link (except in the case of start links) gets a unique subscript, which is applied to all the nonterminals in the link, so that each link is unique in the grammar. We construct a new grammar u O whose set of productions w O is determined as follows: for each production, we identify the nullable links on the RHS and replace them with each combination of the non-original versions found earlier. If a string is left empty during this process, that string is removed from the RHS and the fan-out of the production component is reduced by one. The link on the LHS is replaced with its appropriate matching non-original link. There is one exception to the replacements. If a production consists of all nullable strings, do not include this case. Lastly, we remove all strings on the RHS of productions that have ’s, and reduce the fan-out of the productions accordingly. Once again, we replace the LHS link with the appropriate version. case and are nullable - so we create 54 a new version of both links: and . We then alter the productions. Pro-duction (31) gets replaced by (40). A new produc-tion based on (30) is Production (38). Lastly, Pro-duction (29) has two nullable strings on the RHS, so it gets altered to add three new productions, (34), (35) and (36). The altered set of productions are the following:\nFootnote or Reference Text: I. Dan Melamed, G. Satta, and B. Wellington. 2004. Gener-alized multitext grammars.

Experts on discourse structure wrote a set of attachment rules, Labeling Functions (LFs), with reference to this development set. Although the whole of the STAC corpus is annotated, we treated the remainder of the corpus as unseen/u-nannotated data in order to simulate the conditions in which the snorkel framework is meant to be used, i.e. where there is a large amount of unla-beled data but where it is only feasible to hand la-bel a relatively small portion of it.

The back-end data collection and computation layer performs pre-processing of tweets, computing check-worthiness scores of tweets using the public ClaimBuster API (Hassan et al., 2017a), Elasticsearch batch insertion, de-tecting claim types of tweets, and finding similar fact-checked claims for each tweet, using Claim-Buster API.

The Twitter REST API provides us with the necessary data. However, the system does not require all of it. In fact, a lot of the API’s response is discarded to keep our database small and yet sufficient enough to pro-vide all necessary information for the portal. This is achieved through the ClaimPortal API. The API is a web service designed using Python and the Flask micro-framework. It provides end points for loading tweets on the GUI, search for hashtags, and search for users in applying from-user and user-mention filters. Based on the keyword search and filters requested by a user, the API queries the database to find the resulting list of tweet IDs and returns the list as a JSON response. A tweet ID is a unique number assigned to a tweet by Twitter.

Claim-Buster (Hassan et al., 2017a; Jimenez and Li, 2018) is a classification and ranking model trained on a human-labeled dataset of 8,000 sentences from past U.S. presidential debates. The Claim-Buster API returns a check-worthiness score for any given text. The score is on a scale from 0 to 1, ranging from least check-worthy to most check-worthy. The background task of probing Claim-Buster API for getting scores for tweets is another batch process, in parallel with the tweet collection and the Elasticsearch indexing processes.\nFootnote or Reference Text: 6 https://idir.uta.edu/claimbuster/<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nBased on the given information, here's the extracted meta-information about the research data cited:\n\n- **Source Title:** ClaimBuster API\n- **Source Type:** Fact-checking tool\n- **Developed by:** The research group\n- **Year of Development:** Not explicitly mentioned\n- **Training Data:** Human-labeled dataset of 8,000 sentences from past U.S. presidential debates\n- **Training Data Source:** Past U.S. presidential debates\n- **Training Data Size:** 8,000 sentences\n- **Training Data Type:** Human-labeled\n- **Training Data Authors:** Hassan et al.
