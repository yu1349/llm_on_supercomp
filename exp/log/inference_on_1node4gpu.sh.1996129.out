input_sample::: {'text': '[SectionTitle] 4 Composition in a K&G Parser [Body] Parser We use UUParser, a variant of the K&G transition-based parser that employs the arc-hybrid transition system from Kuhlmann et al. (2011) extended with a S WAP transition and a Static-Dynamic oracle, as described in de Lhoneux et al. (2017b) [Cite_Footnote_4] . The S WAP transition is used to allow the construction of non-projective dependency trees (Nivre, 2009). We use default hyperparameters. When using POS tags, we use the universal POS tags from the UD treebanks which are coarse-grained and consistent across languages. Those POS tags are predicted by UDPipe (Straka et al., 2016) both for training and parsing. This parser obtained the 7th best LAS score on average in the 2018 CoNLL shared task (Zeman et al., 2018), about 2.5 LAS points below the best system, which uses an ensemble system as well as ELMo embed-dings, as introduced by Peters et al. (2018). Note, however, that we use a slightly impoverished ver-sion of the model used for the shared task which is described in Smith et al. (2018a): we use a less ac-curate POS tagger (UDPipe) and we do not make use of multi-treebank models. In addition, Smith et al. (2018a) use the three top items of the stack as well as the first item of the buffer to represent the configuration, while we only use the two top items of the stack and the first item of the buffer. Smith et al. (2018a) also use an extended feature set as introduced by Kiperwasser and Goldberg (2016b) where they also use the rightmost and left-most children of the items of the stack and buffer that they consider. We do not use that extended feature set. This is to keep the parser settings as simple as possible and avoid adding confounding factors. It is still a near-SOTA model. We evaluate parsing models on the development sets and report the average of the 5 best results in 30 epochs and 5 runs with different random seeds.

Given a corpus of dependency graphs, they estimate the conditional entropy of the POS tag of a random token’s parent, conditioned on the token’s type. In a language where this HPE-mean metric is low, most tokens can predict the POS of their parent even without context. We compute HPE-mean from dependency parses of the Europarl data, generated using UDPipe 1.2.0 (Straka et al., 2016) and freely-available tokenization, tagging, parsing models trained on the Universal Depen-dencies 2.0 treebanks (Straka and Strakov, 2017)  .\nFootnote or Reference Text: Milan Straka and Jana Strakov. 2017.

The information is in the section titled "5 What Correlates with Difficulty?" with some body text and a footnote/reference.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the body text. It mentions Head-POS Entropy (HPE-mean) as a measure of morphosyntactic complexity proposed by Dehouck and Denis (2018). The method involves calculating the conditional entropy of a token\'s parent\'s POS tag based on the token\'s type in a dependency graph. The data used is from Europarl, processed with UDPipe 1.2.0 by Straka et al. (2016), using models from Universal Dependencies 2.0 by Straka and Strakov (2017).\n\nThe footnote or reference text gives more details about Straka and Strakov\'s 2017 work, which is about tokenizing, POS tagging, etc., for UD 2.0 with UDPipe. The URL provided there is the same as the one given, so that\'s the dataset they\'re referencing. The title of the paper is "Tokenizing, POS tagging, lemmatizing and parsing UD 2.0 with UDPipe" and it\'s part of the CoNLL 2017 Shared Task. The models are documented at the given URL.\n\nNow, the task is to extract meta-information. That would typically include things like the title of the dataset, authors, publication year, description, methodology, data source, tools used, etc. The URL itself is the identifier. The authors mentioned are Milan Straka and Jana Strakov from 2017. The title of their work is as mentioned. The dataset is the models used for tokenizing, tagging, lemmatizing, and parsing UD 2.0 with UDPipe. The data source is the Universal Dependencies 2.0 treebanks. The tools include UDPipe 1.2.0. The purpose is for multilingual parsing.\n\nI should also note that the dataset is part of a shared task (CoNLL 2017 Shared Task), and the models are freely available.

We tokenize it using the re-versible language-agnostic tokenizer of Mielke and Eisner (2018) [Cite_Footnote_31] and split the obtained 78169 para-graphs into training set, development set for tuning our language models, and test set for our regres-sion, again by dividing the data into blocks of 30 paragraphs and then taking 5 sentences for the de-velopment and test set each, leaving the remainder for the training set. This way we ensure uniform division over sessions of the parliament and sizes of 2 / 3 , 1 / 6 , and 1 / 6 , respectively.\nFootnote or Reference Text: 31 http://sjmielke.com/papers/tokenize/<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, let\'s tackle this query. The user wants me to extract meta-information about research data from a given URL. The URL is the same as the footnote reference, so I need to check if that\'s relevant.\n\nFirst, the section title is "D Data selection: Europarl." That tells me the dataset is Europarl. The body text mentions CoStEP having markup that they stripped, then tokenized using the reversible language-agnostic tokenizer from Mielke and Eisner 2018. The footnote points to the same URL as the given one, which is the paper\'s URL. \n\nLooking at the body text, they split the data into training, development, and test sets. The numbers: 78169 paragraphs, divided into blocks of 30. Then 5 sentences each for dev and test, so the remaining goes to training. The split ratios are 2/3, 1/6, 1/6. They also mention ensuring uniform division over parliamentary sessions, so the data is organized by session. \n\nI need to list the data source, tokenizer used, split method, split ratios, and data characteristics. The dataset is Europarl, and they used their own tokenizer. The split is based on blocks of 30 paragraphs, taking 5 sentences for dev and test. The ratios are 2/3, 1/6, 1/6. Also, they removed markup from CoStEP, so the raw text is used. \n\nWait, the original dataset is Europarl, but they mention CoStEP in the text. Maybe CoStEP is a version of Europarl with markup? So the actual source is Europarl, but they processed it by stripping markup. The tokenizer is from Mielke and Eisner 2018, which is the same as the footnote reference. \n\nI should make sure to note the dataset name as Europarl, the tokenizer details, how the data was split (block method, ratios), and any preprocessing steps like stripping markup. Also, the purpose of the data is for training language models and regression testing.

The actual data collection might be more recent, but the user hasn\'t provided that info. So maybe the dataset name is the MTurk data collected for this study, but since the study\'s details aren\'t given, we can only cite MTurk as the platform used.\n\nThe body text says they used MTurk to conduct the user study.

Intuitively, popular product features are frequently mentioned in reviews, so they can be extracted by simply mining frequently occurring nouns (Hu and Liu, 2004). However, this strategy will also find many noise terms (e.g., commonly used nouns like thing, one, etc.). To produce high quality seeds, we employ a Domain Relevance Measure (DRM) (Jiang and Tan, 2010), which combines term frequency with a domain-specific measuring metric called Likelihood Ratio Test (LRT) (Dunning, 1993). Let λ(t) denotes the LRT score of a product feature candidate t, where k 1 and k 2 are the frequencies of t in the review corpus R and a background corpus [Cite_Footnote_1] B, n 1 and n 2 are the total number of terms in R and B, p = (k 1 + k 2 )/(n 1 + n 2 ), p 1 = k 1 /n 1 and p 2 = k 2 /n 2 . Then a modified DRM 2 is proposed, where tf(t) is the frequency of t in R and df(t) is the frequency of t in B.\nFootnote or Reference Text: 1 Google-n-Gram (http://books.google.com/ngrams) is used as the background corpus.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants me to extract meta-information about research data from the given URL and the provided section. The URL is for Google Ngrams, and the section is about a proposed method for automatic seed generation.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the body text. The seed set has positive (product features) and negative examples. They mention using term frequency but also a Domain Relevance Measure (DRM) combining it with LRT from Dunning. The formula uses frequencies in the review corpus and a background corpus. The footnote says Google Ngrams is used as the background corpus. \n\nSo the data source here is Google Ngrams. The type is a background corpus, which is domain-specific. The purpose is for the LRT to measure relevance. The creators would be Google, and the URL is provided. The data type is text corpus, and it's from books based on the URL. The license isn't mentioned, but maybe it's under Google's terms. \n\nI should check if there are any other references in the body text, like the works by Hu and Liu, Jiang and Tan, and Dunning. But the main data source here is the Google Ngrams for the background corpus. The key points are the use of LRT with term frequencies from both review and background corpora. The data is used in the DRM to filter noise terms. \n\nWait, the footnote specifically says Google-n-Gram is used as the background corpus, so that's the main data point. The other references are methods but not data sources. So the meta-info should focus on the Google Ngrams corpus. Need to make sure I include the URL, the purpose (background corpus for LRT), the creators, data type, domain, and maybe the access date if possible. Since the URL is provided, the access date isn't specified here. \n\nAlso, the data is from books, so the domain is literature or general text. The type is text corpus. The license isn't stated, but the footnote doesn't mention it, so maybe it's just the standard Google terms. \n\nI think that's all.

The main focus here is on capturing lexical semantic clues using a semantic similarity graph and learning word embeddings.\n\nLooking at the body text: It mentions using EB (probably an encoder or model) trained on a large corpus C, then fine-tuned on a target review corpus R. They use a statistic-based method from Zhu et al. (2009) to detect noun phrases and an Unfolding Recursive Autoencoder from Socher et al. (2011) for embeddings.

Thus, GCNF is a more restrictive normal form than those used by Wu (1997) and Melamed (2003). The absence of ’s simplifies parsers for GMTG (Melamed, 2004)  . Given a GMTG u with in some productions, we give the construction of a weakly equivalent gram-mar u9O without any ’s. First, determine all nullable links and associated - strings in u . - A link * Z Z is nullable if < y is an ITV where at least one y•bhg is . We say the link is nullable and the string at address in is nullable. For each nullable link, we create versions of the link, where is the number of nullable strings of that link. There is one version for each of the possible combinations of the nullable strings being present or absent. The version of the link with all strings present is its original version. Each non-original version of the link (except in the case of start links) gets a unique subscript, which is applied to all the nonterminals in the link, so that each link is unique in the grammar. We construct a new grammar u O whose set of productions w O is determined as follows: for each production, we identify the nullable links on the RHS and replace them with each combination of the non-original versions found earlier. If a string is left empty during this process, that string is removed from the RHS and the fan-out of the production component is reduced by one. The link on the LHS is replaced with its appropriate matching non-original link. There is one exception to the replacements. If a production consists of all nullable strings, do not include this case. Lastly, we remove all strings on the RHS of productions that have ’s, and reduce the fan-out of the productions accordingly. Once again, we replace the LHS link with the appropriate version. case and are nullable - so we create 54 a new version of both links: and . We then alter the productions. Pro-duction (31) gets replaced by (40). A new produc-tion based on (30) is Production (38). Lastly, Pro-duction (29) has two nullable strings on the RHS, so it gets altered to add three new productions, (34), (35) and (36). The altered set of productions are the following:\nFootnote or Reference Text: I. Dan Melamed, G. Satta, and B. Wellington. 2004. Gener-alized multitext grammars.

The footnote [Cite_Footnote_2] links to the GitHub URL again, with the text "event detection without triggers" which might indicate the repository\'s focus.\n\nLooking at the footnote reference text, it\'s the same URL, but the description says "event detection without triggers." That\'s important because it tells me the specific aspect of the research this repository addresses. The main paper\'s section mentions using annotated triggers, but this repository\'s project is about detection without them.\n\nNow, to extract the meta-information. The dataset is clearly ACE2005. The research domain is NLP, specifically event detection. The methodology involves comparing baselines and approaches without annotated triggers. The code repository is the GitHub link provided, and the project\'s name or identifier is "event" as per the URL. The key findings are that their method outperforms baselines and is competitive with methods using annotated triggers.

Let me look through the section title, body text, and footnote.\n\nThe section title is "2 System Architecture and Components 2.1 System Architecture". The body text talks about ClaimPortal\'s components, including Elasticsearch as the search engine. It mentions that Elasticsearch is used for keyword search on tweets and is coupled with querying the database. Also, in the back-end layer, Elasticsearch is used for batch insertion. The footnote reference is just the URL again.\n\nSo, the meta-information should include the name of the software (Elasticsearch), the version or edition if available.

The Twitter REST API provides us with the necessary data. However, the system does not require all of it. In fact, a lot of the API’s response is discarded to keep our database small and yet sufficient enough to pro-vide all necessary information for the portal. This is achieved through the ClaimPortal API. The API is a web service designed using Python and the Flask micro-framework. It provides end points for loading tweets on the GUI, search for hashtags, and search for users in applying from-user and user-mention filters. Based on the keyword search and filters requested by a user, the API queries the database to find the resulting list of tweet IDs and returns the list as a JSON response.

This section is about the system\'s components, specifically how they monitor, process, and store tweets. The body text mentions that the Twitter REST API is used for data, but not all data is stored. They discard some parts to keep the database small. They use a Python Flask API to handle data processing, including endpoints for loading tweets, searching hashtags, and users. The API queries the database for tweet IDs and returns JSON.
